import Functions

""" Please Read
This is where you will run and call functions.
For example, you can type Functions.getWeek() and it
will print out what you'll eat at school for the week.
Remember that you'll have to insert your school's name without
ÅÄÖ and you'll also have to insert your weather.com URL (US as
the selected country) into the variables in Functions.py.
All functions will have to be printed by yourself except
for the getWeek() function.
